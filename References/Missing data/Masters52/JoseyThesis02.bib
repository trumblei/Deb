	abstract = {Multilevel and longitudinal studies are frequently subject to missing data. For example, biomarker studies for oral cancer may involve multiple assays for each participant. Assays may fail, resulting in missing data values that can be assumed to be missing completely at random. Catellier and Muller proposed a data analytic technique to account for data missing at random in multilevel and longitudinal studies. They suggested modifying the degrees of freedom for both the Hotelling-Lawley trace F statistic and its null case reference distribution. We propose parallel adjustments to approximate power for this multivariate test in studies with missing data. The power approximations use a modified non-central F statistic, which is a function of (i) the expected number of complete cases, (ii) the expected number of non-missing pairs of responses, or (iii) the trimmed sample size, which is the planned sample size reduced by the anticipated proportion of missing data. The accuracy of the method is assessed by comparing the theoretical results to the Monte Carlo simulated power for the Catellier and Muller multivariate test. Over all experimental conditions, the closest approximation to the empirical power of the Catellier and Muller multivariate test is obtained by adjusting power calculations with the expected number of complete cases. The utility of the method is demonstrated with a multivariate power analysis for a hypothetical oral cancer biomarkers study. We describe how to implement the method using standard, commercially available software products and give example code. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {For small samples of Gaussian repeated measures with missing data, Barton and Cramer recommended using the EM algorithm for estimation and reducing the degrees of freedom for an analogue of Rao's F approximation to Wilks' test.

We describe analogues of the Pillai-Bartlett trace, Hotelling-Lawley trace and Geisser-Greenhouse corrected univariate tests which allow for missing data. Eleven sample size adjustments were examined which replace N by some function of the numbers of non-missing pairs of responses in computing error degrees of freedom. Overall, simulation results allowed concluding that an adjusted test can always control test size at or below the nominal rate, even with as few as 12 observations and up to 10 per cent missing data. The choice of method varies with the test statistic. Replacing N by the mean number of non-missing responses per variable works best for the Geisser-Greenhouse test. The Pillai-Bartlett test requires the stronger adjustment of replacing N by the harmonic mean number of non-missing pairs of responses. For Wilks' and Hotelling-Lawley, an even more aggressive adjustment based on the minimum number of non-missing pairs must be used.},

	issn = {0277-6715},
	abstract = {The convenience of linear mixed models for Gaussian data has led to their widespread use. Unfortunately, standard mixed model tests often have greatly inflated test size in small samples. Many applications with correlated outcomes in medical imaging and other fields have simple properties which do not require the generality of a mixed model. Alternately, stating the special cases as a general linear multivariate model allows analysing them with either the univariate or multivariate approach to repeated measures (UNIREP, MULTIREP). Even in small samples, an appropriate UNIREP or MULTIREP test always controls test size and has a good power approximation, in sharp contrast to mixed model tests. Hence, mixed model tests should never be used when one of the UNIREP tests (uncorrected, Huynh-Feldt, Geisser-Greenhouse, Box conservative) or MULTIREP tests (Wilks, Hotelling-Lawley, Roy's, Pillai-Bartlett) apply. Convenient methods give exact power for the uncorrected and Box conservative tests. Simulations demonstrate that new power approximations for all four UNIREP tests eliminate most inaccuracy in existing methods. In turn, free software implements the approximations to give a better choice of sample size. Two repeated measures power analyses illustrate the methods. The examples highlight the advantages of examining the entire response surface of power as a function of sample size, mean differences, and variability.},

	abstract = {Existing methods for power analysis for longitudinal study designs are limited in that they do not adequately address random missing data patterns. Although the pattern of missing data can be assessed during data analysis, it is unknown during the design phase of a study. The random nature of the missing data pattern adds another layer of complexity in addressing missing data for power analysis. In this paper, we model the occurrence of missing data with a two-state, first-order Markov process and integrate the modelling information into the power function to account for random missing data patterns. The Markov model is easily specified to accommodate different anticipated missing data processes. We develop this approach for the two most popular longitudinal models: the generalized estimating equations (GEE) and the linear mixed-effects model under the missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption. For GEE, we also limit our consideration to the working independence correlation model. The proposed methodology is illustrated with numerous examples that are motivated by real study designs.},

	abstract = {Recently developed methods for power analysis expand the options available for study design. We demonstrate how easily the methods can be applied by (1) reviewing their formulation and (2) describing their application in the preparation of a particular grant proposal. The focus is a complex but ubiquitous setting: repeated measures in a longitudinal study. Describing the development of the research proposal allows demonstrating the steps needed to conduct an effective power analysis. Discussion of the example also highlights issues that typically must be considered in designing a study. First, we discuss the motivation for using detailed power calculations, focusing on multivariate methods in particular. Second, we survey available methods for the general linear multivariate model (GLMM) with Gaussian errors and recommend those based on F approximations. The treatment includes coverage of the multivariate and univariate approaches to repeated measures, MANOVA, ANOVA, multivariate regression, and univariate regression. Third, we describe the design of the power analysis for the example, a longitudinal study of a child's intellectual performance as a function of mother's estimated verbal intelligence. Fourth, we present the results of the power calculations. Fifth, we evaluate the tradeoffs in using reduced designs and tests to simplify power calculations. Finally, we discuss the benefits and costs of power analysis in the practice of statistics. We make three recommendations: Align the design and hypothesis of the power analysis with the planned data analysis, as best as practical.Embed any power analysis in a defensible sensitivity analysis.Have the extent of the power analysis reflect the ethical, scientific, and monetary costs. We conclude that power analysis catalyzes the interaction of statisticians and subject matter specialists. Using the recent advances for power analysis in linear models can further invigorate the interaction.},

Conventionally, estimates of precision and inference for fixed effects are based on their asymptotic distribution, which is known to be inadequate for some small-sample problems. In this paper, we present a scaled Wald statistic, together with an F approximation to its sampling distribution, that is shown to perform well in a range of small sample settings. The statistic uses an adjusted estimator of the covariance matrix that has reduced small sample bias. This approach has the advantage that it reproduces both the statistics and F distributions in those settings where the latter is exact, namely for Hotelling T2 type statistics and for analysis of variance F-ratios. The performance of the modified statistics is assessed through simulation studies of four different REML analyses and the methods are illustrated using three examples.},

	abstract = {Statisticians most often use the linear mixed model to analyze Gaussian longitudinal data. The value and familiarity of the R(2) statistic in the linear univariate model naturally creates great interest in extending it to the linear mixed model. We define and describe how to compute a model R(2) statistic for the linear mixed model by using only a single model. The proposed R(2) statistic measures multivariate association between the repeated outcomes and the fixed effects in the linear mixed model. The R(2) statistic arises as a 1-1 function of an appropriate F statistic for testing all fixed effects (except typically the intercept) in a full model. The statistic compares the full model with a null model with all fixed effects deleted (except typically the intercept) while retaining exactly the same covariance structure. Furthermore, the R(2) statistic leads immediately to a natural definition of a partial R(2) statistic. A mixed model in which ethnicity gives a very small p-value as a longitudinal predictor of blood pressure (BP) compellingly illustrates the value of the statistic. In sharp contrast to the extreme p-value, a very small R(2) , a measure of statistical and scientific importance, indicates that ethnicity has an almost negligible association with the repeated BP outcomes for the study.},

The cause of this problem is shown to be a missing term in the underlying Taylor series expansion which accommodates the bias in the estimators of the parameters of the covariance structure.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercise confers short-term benefits for individuals with Parkinson disease (PD).
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to compare short- and long-term responses among 2 supervised exercise programs and a home-based control exercise program.
DESIGN: The 16-month randomized controlled exercise intervention investigated 3 exercise approaches: flexibility/balance/function exercise (FBF), supervised aerobic exercise (AE), and home-based exercise (control).
SETTING: This study was conducted in outpatient clinics.
PATIENTS: The participants were 121 individuals with PD (Hoehn \& Yahr stages 1-3).
INTERVENTIONS: The FBF program (individualized spinal and extremity flexibility exercises followed by group balance/functional training) was supervised by a physical therapist. The AE program (using a treadmill, bike, or elliptical trainer) was supervised by an exercise trainer. Supervision was provided 3 days per week for 4 months, and then monthly (16 months total). The control group participants exercised at home using the National Parkinson Foundation Fitness Counts program, with 1 supervised, clinic-based group session per month.
MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes, obtained by blinded assessors, were determined at 4, 10, and 16 months. The primary outcome measures were overall physical function (Continuous Scale-Physical Functional Performance [CS-PFP]), balance (Functional Reach Test [FRT]), and walking economy (oxygen uptake [mL/kg/min]). Secondary outcome measures were symptom severity (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [UPDRS] activities of daily living [ADL] and motor subscales) and quality of life (39-item Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Scale [PDQ-39]).
RESULTS: Of the 121 participants, 86.8\%, 82.6\%, and 79.3\% completed 4, 10, and 16 months, respectively, of the intervention. At 4 months, improvement in CS-PFP scores was greater in the FBF group than in the control group (mean difference=4.3, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.2 to 7.3) and the AE group (mean difference=3.1, 95\% CI=0.0 to 6.2). Balance was not different among groups at any time point. Walking economy improved in the AE group compared with the FBF group at 4 months (mean difference=-1.2, 95\% CI=-1.9 to -0.5), 10 months (mean difference=-1.2, 95\% CI=-1.9 to -0.5), and 16 months (mean difference=-1.7, 95\% CI=-2.5 to -1.0). The only secondary outcome that showed significant differences was UPDRS ADL subscale scores: the FBF group performed better than the control group at 4 months (mean difference=-1.47, 95\% CI=-2.79 to -0.15) and 16 months (mean difference=-1.95, 95\% CI=-3.84 to -0.08).
LIMITATIONS: Absence of a non-exercise control group was a limitation of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated overall functional benefits at 4 months in the FBF group and improved walking economy (up to 16 months) in the AE group.},

Participants included 605 mother-offspring dyads from the Healthy Start study, an ongoing, pre-birth prospective cohort study in Denver, Colorado, USA.

General linear univariate models were used for analysis, adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), offspring sex, and gestational age at birth. Non-Hispanic white race, lower pre-pregnancy BMI, higher prenatal vitamin D intake, and summer births were associated with higher cord blood 25(OH)D. Higher 25(OH)D was associated with lower birthweight (β = -6.22, p = 0.02), but as maternal BMI increased, this association became increasingly positive in direction and magnitude (β = 1.05, p = 0.04). Higher 25(OH)D was also associated with lower neonatal adiposity (β = -0.02, p {\textless} 0.05) but not after adjustment for maternal BMI (β = -0.01, p = 0.25).

A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed.

	abstract = {In longitudinal clinical trials, some subjects will drop out before completing the trial, so their measurements towards the end of the trial are not obtained. Mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with "unstructured" (UN) covariance structure are increasingly common as a primary analysis for group comparisons in these trials. Furthermore, model-based covariance estimators have been routinely used for testing the group difference and estimating confidence intervals of the difference in the MMRM analysis using the UN covariance. However, using the MMRM analysis with the UN covariance could lead to convergence problems for numerical optimization, especially in trials with a small-sample size. Although the so-called sandwich covariance estimator is robust to misspecification of the covariance structure, its performance deteriorates in settings with small-sample size. We investigated the performance of the sandwich covariance estimator and covariance estimators adjusted for small-sample bias proposed by Kauermann and Carroll ( J Am Stat Assoc 2001; 96: 1387-1396) and Mancl and DeRouen ( Biometrics 2001; 57: 126-134) fitting simpler covariance structures through a simulation study. In terms of the type 1 error rate and coverage probability of confidence intervals, Mancl and DeRouen's covariance estimator with compound symmetry, first-order autoregressive (AR(1)), heterogeneous AR(1), and antedependence structures performed better than the original sandwich estimator and Kauermann and Carroll's estimator with these structures in the scenarios where the variance increased across visits. The performance based on Mancl and DeRouen's estimator with these structures was nearly equivalent to that based on the Kenward-Roger method for adjusting the standard errors and degrees of freedom with the UN structure. The model-based covariance estimator with the UN structure under unadjustment of the degrees of freedom, which is frequently used in applications, resulted in substantial inflation of the type 1 error rate. We recommend the use of Mancl and DeRouen's estimator in MMRM analysis if the number of subjects completing is ( n + 5) or less, where n is the number of planned visits. Otherwise, the use of Kenward and Roger's method with UN structure should be the best way.},

The data in these studies consist of a large number of binary responses from each subject and a small number of subjects (Haffajee et al. (1983), Goodson (1986), Jenkins et al. (1988)) Computer simulations were employed to investigate GEE based both on an empirical estimate of the variance-covariance matrix and a model-based estimate. Results from this investigation indicate that hypothesis testing based on GEE resulted in inappropriate Type I error rates when small samples are employed. Only an increase in the number of subjects to the point where it matched the number of observations per subject resulted in appropriate Type I error rates},

	abstract = {Repeated ordinal outcomes are common in behavioral and medical sciences. Due to the familiarity, simplicity and robustness of ANOVA methodology, this approach has been frequently used for repeated ordinal data. Weighted least squares (WLS) and generalized estimating equations (GEE) are usually the procedures of choice for repeated ordinal data since, unlike ANOVA, they generally make no or few untenable assumptions. However, these methods are based on asymptotic results and their properties are not well understood for small samples. Moreover, few software packages have procedures for implementing these methods. This paper investigates the performance of ANOVA, MANOVA, WLS, and GEE for repeated ordinal data with small sample sizes. For a design with two groups and four time points, our simulation results indicated that ANOVA with the Huynh‐Feldt adjustment performed matrix, known as sphericity, or the H‐F condition, is a sufficient condition for the usual F tests to be valid. The sphericity condition is met if the Vax(Yijt-Yijt') is equal to some constant for all t≠t′ (see Milliken and Johnson (1984, pp. 324-325)).},
